    <h1>World's Fastest cars</h1>

    <h2>3.Hennessey Venom F5</h2>
    <h3><p>Top speed: 272mph (for now)<br>
        0-60mph: 2.6 seconds<br>
        
        The folks in the USA are smashing the top speed game recently, with third place going to another all-American supercar. The Hennessey Venom F5 has a 6.6-litre twin-turbocharged V8 with 1,817hp and 1,617Nm of torque.
        
        That’s enough to launch it from 0-60mph in 2.6 seconds, and it’ll go onto a top speed of 272mph – for now. Hennessey want’s to get even more out of the F5, with the firm targeting a top speed of over 300mph.</p></h3>
        <h2>2.SSC Tuatara</h2>
        <h3><p>Top speed: 295mph<br>
            0-60mph: 2.5 seconds<br>
            
            While the Bugatti Chiron’s complicated W16 engine is mightily impressive, sometimes you just can’t beat a whopping great V8 with a couple of turbos strapped to it. The SSC Tuatara (Too-ah-ta-ra) has a twin-turbocharged V8 which puts out up to 1,750hp when it’s running on ethanol,  however there is some controversy around the official top speed.
            
            You see, SSC claimed the Tuatara actually managed 316mph in October 2020 to make it the world’s fastest car — but later admitted to a GPS error that depicted that speed wrongly. Tests in early 2023 saw the car hit an actual top speed of 295mph, not exactly slow.</p></h3>
            <h2>1.Bugatti Chiron Supersport 300+</h2>
            <h3><p>Top speed: 304mph<br>
                0-60mph: 2.2 seconds<br>
                
                Those who grew up in the 2000s will probably associate the fastest car in the world with the legendary Bugatti Veyron. Well that car’s spirit has been carried over to the Bugatti Chiron Supersport 300+, an 8.0-litre quad turbocharged 1,600hp mega machine which will do, as the name suggests, over 300mph.
                
                Specifically, it did 304mph when the French firm unleashed it at Volkswagen’s Ehra-Lessien test track. The Chiron 300+ doesn’t hold the official world record though, as it only did the run in one direction. To break the record you have to do it twice in opposite directions, which Bugatti decided not to do for some reason.</p></h3>
